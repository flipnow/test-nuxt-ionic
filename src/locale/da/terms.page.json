        "heading": "Description of the Service",
        "content": "The Service is an online business-to-consumer (B2C) marketplace. Sprii does not sell or purchase any goods itself, nor take possession of the goods, either for itself or on behalf of users or others. While Sprii may help facilitate transactions, Sellers that list and sell items through the Service are entirely responsible for the sale of the products. That includes transactions between them, including (without limitation) the listing of goods and any applicable product warranties. By using our Service, your transaction will be fulfilled and processed by the seller and its designated payment processor (a “Third-Party Transaction”). All Third-Party Transactions are subject to the applicable Seller’s Terms of Service that will be presented to you during checkout and before payment. By purchasing goods from any Seller, you acknowledge that you agree to and are bound by the applicable Seller Terms. Sprii and the Sellers are unaffiliated companies and Sprii has no influence on or control over the operations of any Seller, and Sprii assumes no responsibility for the content, accuracy, practices, or opinions expressed in any Seller’s Terms. We encourage you to be aware when you engage in a Transaction and to read all applicable Seller Terms in advance. Sprii shall in no way be held responsible for any losses or damages, direct or indirect, pecuniary, or otherwise, resulting from any error or failure on the part of a Seller. By using the Service, you release and hold us harmless from all liability arising from your interactions with a Seller. Sellers may change or become unavailable; in the event of any termination of a Seller, you must look solely to that Seller (and not to Sprii) for any refunds, chargebacks, payment reversals, customer service, and dispute resolution related to such termination. By using the Service, you agree to also comply with our Privacy Policy that can also be found in the footer of the Sprii Platform"
